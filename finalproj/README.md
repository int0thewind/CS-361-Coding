# CS 361 - Final Project
This directory stores the final project files for CS 361 SP 20 semester. In this semester, we implement Stochastic Optimization algorithm for our final project. Due to copyright, the description of the final project is not added to the repository. Original repository can be found here [here](https://github.com/brian-yang/cs361-final-project).

This project can be executed on Kaggle, though this folder only contains the local version of the final project. Detailed environment setup for Kaggle can also be found in the original repository.
